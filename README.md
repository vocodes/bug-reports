Vo.codes - Feature Requests and Bug Reports
===========================================
This Github project is used for submitting feature requests and bug reports. 

You shouldn't make any suggestions for voices here. 
The [voice suggestion spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z9zm5KbZaLv7Gadl6iHCAdVjwehuj4RyxoSwTm7tBec/edit#gid=0)
tracks these, and you can feel free to edit and contribute.

To submit a bug report or feature request, sign up for Github and 
[submit them as Issues](https://github.com/vocodes/feature-requests-and-bug-reports/issues).

I'll be able to ask questions if necessary and assign a priority. Even if I can't work on it right away, 
having it in the issue tracker helps ensure it doesn't get lost.

To keep track of the current backlog, see the [Project Kanban Board](https://github.com/vocodes/feature-requests-and-bug-reports/projects/1).
You can see what is actively being worked on.
